# FaceClassification
- Face detection based on Haar cascade classifier using openCV.
	- Images are acquired from the webcam and the detected faces can be optionally stored in a folder that will be then used as training set for the face classifier
- Face classification based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on Keras
	- After the training face the newtork can be tested in real time using the script "real_time_face_classification.py"
	- The code can handle multiple face classification (see sample below)
